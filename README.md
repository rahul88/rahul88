- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rahul88. In my day job I am a Software Developer in Test, from Manchester, UK. I used to specialise in UI testing, using Webdriver, and more recently Cypress, however have now moved onto focussing more on Performance Testing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, Terraform, Docker from a devops perspective. Also metrics gathering such as Grafana from a performance testing perspective.
